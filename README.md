# Deep Learning with Keras: CIFAR-10 Image Classification

This project demonstrates image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras, focusing on building, training, and evaluating a convolutional neural network (CNN).

---

## Dataset Overview

The [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It's a standard benchmark dataset in computer vision.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Load the CIFAR-10 dataset using Keras's `datasets` module.
   - Normalize image data to improve model performance.

2. **Model Construction:**
   - Create a CNN architecture using Keras's `Sequential` API.
   - Include key layers like `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Flatten`, `Dense`, and `Dropout` for robust feature extraction and classification.

3. **Compilation:**
   - Configure the model with an appropriate loss function, optimizer (`Adam`), and evaluation metrics (`accuracy`).

4. **Training:**
   - Train the model on the CIFAR-10 training data while monitoring validation performance.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Test the model on unseen data and visualize the training history (accuracy and loss).

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- Keras (with TensorFlow backend)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

---

## Results

- The trained CNN achieved an accuracy of approximately **X%** on the CIFAR-10 test set (replace `X%` with the actual accuracy achieved in your training).
- Plots for training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs provide insights into the model's learning behavior.
